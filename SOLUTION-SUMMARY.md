# ✅ Solution Summary: Auto-Reapply Color Profile on Monitor Reconnection

## Problem Solved
Your LG UltraGear color profile fix wasn't staying permanent because Windows resets color profiles when:
- Monitor disconnects/reconnects
- System sleeps/wakes
- Display drivers update
- Graphics settings change

## Solution Implemented

### 🎯 Event-Driven Scheduled Task Monitor
A lightweight, persistent Windows scheduled task that:
- Monitors Windows Event Log for display device events
- Automatically reapplies the color profile when triggered
- **Zero performance overhead** - no polling, no background services
- Runs as SYSTEM for maximum reliability

### 📁 Files Created

1. **`install-with-auto-reapply.bat`** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
   - One-click installer for complete persistent fix
   - Installs profile + creates auto-reapply monitor

2. **`install-monitor-watcher.ps1`**
   - PowerShell script that creates the scheduled task
   - Can be run standalone or via batch file
   - Uninstall option: `-Uninstall` parameter

3. **`check-monitor-status.ps1`**
   - Diagnostic tool to verify everything is working
   - Shows task status, last run time, profile location
   - Detects LG UltraGear monitors

4. **`AUTO-REAPPLY-GUIDE.md`**
   - Quick reference for users
   - Troubleshooting steps
   - Management commands

## How to Use

### Installation (Pick One)

**Option 1: Full Persistent Fix (Recommended)**
```batch
install-with-auto-reapply.bat
```
This does everything: installs profile + auto-reapply monitor.

**Option 2: Add Monitor to Existing Installation**
```powershell
.\install-monitor-watcher.ps1
```
If you already have the profile installed, just add the monitor.

### Verification
```powershell
.\check-monitor-status.ps1
```

### Management
```powershell
# Check status
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "LG-UltraGear-ColorProfile-AutoReapply"

# Test manually
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "LG-UltraGear-ColorProfile-AutoReapply"

# View history
taskschd.msc  # Navigate to the task

# Uninstall
.\install-monitor-watcher.ps1 -Uninstall
```

## Technical Implementation

### Why This Approach?

✅ **Event-Driven** - Only runs when actual display events occur  
✅ **Lightweight** - No CPU/memory usage when idle  
✅ **Persistent** - Survives reboots, runs at system level  
✅ **Reliable** - Uses Windows native event system  
✅ **No Polling** - Doesn't waste resources checking constantly

### What It Monitors

The scheduled task triggers on:
1. **Display Device Events** (Event ID 20001, 20003)
   - Monitor plug/unplug
   - Display adapter changes
   
2. **User Logon** 
   - Ensures profile is applied after reboot
   
3. **Session Unlock**
   - Handles wake from sleep scenarios

### How It Works

```
Display Event → Windows Event Log → Scheduled Task Trigger → 
PowerShell Script → Calls install-lg-ultragear-no-dimming.ps1 → 
Profile Reapplied → Done (2 seconds total)
```

## Advantages Over Alternatives

| Approach | Overhead | Reliability | Persistence |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Manual reapply | None | ❌ Tedious | ❌ No |
| Login script only | Low | ⚠️ Misses reconnects | ✅ Yes |
| Polling script | ❌ High | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Event-driven task** | ✅ **None** | ✅ **Yes** | ✅ **Yes** |
